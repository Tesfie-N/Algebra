[My simple command line app later to  be mobile app]

simple algebra project is made to reduce hand calculations of matrix operation, quadratic solution and the like.
steps:
1. choose what mathematical operation you want: matrix operation or quadratic solving
2. If you choose matrix operation , select from matrix addition, subtraction and multiplication

Future Modifications 
1. Instead of quadratic solution making to solve roots of at least degree 5
2. Adding solutions of linear equations
3. and many other algebraic features
